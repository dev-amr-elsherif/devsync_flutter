# 🚀 Project Proposal: DevSync

**AI-Powered Developer Matching Platform**

---

## 1. 📖 Project Overview

**DevSync** is an innovative cross-platform mobile application developed using **Flutter**. It aims to revolutionize how Project Managers (PMs) and Developers connect by utilizing an **AI-driven matching ecosystem**.

The platform serves as a specialized MVP that focuses on **intelligent team formation**. Unlike traditional project management tools, DevSync prioritizes verifiable technical competence by analyzing real-world public GitHub activity, ensuring that project requirements meet the most qualified talent.

---

## 2. ⚠️ Problem Statement

The current recruitment and team-building landscape faces three critical challenges:

- **Verification Gap:** PMs struggle to evaluate the true technical proficiency of developers beyond self-declared CVs.
- **Discovery Friction:** Talented developers often go unnoticed if they lack "keyword-optimized" profiles, even if their actual code is superior.
- **Efficiency Loss:** Manual searching and vetting lead to wasted time, mismatched expectations, and project delays.

---

## 3. 💡 Proposed Solution

DevSync addresses these issues by creating a **data-driven bridge**:

- **AI Chatbot Integration:** Simplifies project definition for PMs through natural language processing.
- **GitHub Evidence:** Uses the GitHub REST API to analyze public commits, languages used, and contribution patterns.
- **Smart Matching:** An AI algorithm that ranks developers based on their actual coding history relative to project needs.

## 4. ⚙️ System Roles & Workflow

### 👨‍💼 Project Manager (PM)

1.  **Requirement Gathering:** Use an AI chatbot to generate project specs (tech stack, roles, duration).
2.  **Manual Calibration:** Review and refine the AI-generated requirements.
3.  **Smart Scouting:** Receive a curated list of recommended developers.
4.  **Team Management:** Send invitations and manage project membership.
5.  **Quality Assurance:** Rate developers upon task completion to refine the global matching pool.

### 👨‍💻 Developer

1.  **Profile Synchronization:** Connect GitHub accounts to showcase real-world contributions.
2.  **Invitation Handling:** Accept or reject project requests tailored to their specific skill set.
3.  **Reputation Building:** Gain "Verified Completion" badges and ratings from PMs to increase future discoverability.

---

## 5. ⭐ Core Features & Functionalities

- **Secure Auth:** Integration with GitHub and Google OAuth.
- **AI Project Architect:** Chatbot-based project setup.
- **GitHub Scraper & Analyzer:** Objective skill evaluation via public data.
- **Recommendation Engine:** Proprietary logic for ranking developer-project fit.
- **Invitation Workflow:** Controlled system for professional outreach.
- **Feedback Loop:** Post-project rating and review system.

---

## 6. 🎯 Project Scope

### ✅ Phase 1: MVP (Current)

- AI project generation and manual editing interface.
- Public GitHub data retrieval and basic analysis.
- Developer recommendation and invitation system.
- Role-based access control (PM vs. Developer).

### 🚀 Phase 2: Future Roadmap

- **Escrow Payments:** Secure financial transactions for completed milestones.
- **Enterprise Dashboard:** A web-based version for large-scale talent management.
- **Private Repo Analysis:** Optional secure scanning for private codebases (with permission).
